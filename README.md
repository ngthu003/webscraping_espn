The project is under progress. Please check back regularly for updates.

**Project's objectives:**
1.  To practice scraping data from online website using rvest
2.  To clean up the scraped data into ready-to-use data.frame
3.  To do exploratory data analysis

Currently, the project is planned to have 4 major parts:
1.  *Functions to automate web mining*
2.  *Web mining*: including setting-up the necessary codes, data.frames, and other information
3.  *Exploratory Data Analysis*: plots to learn about and investigate interesting patterns from the scraped data
4.  *Predictive Models*: statistical learning models to expand findings from part 3 further.
