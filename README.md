# ESPN Soccer tables: a Web Mining project

The project is under progress. Please check back regularly for updates.

**Learning objectives:**
1.  To practice mining data from online website using rvest
2.  To clean up the mined data into ready-to-use data.frame
3.  To do exploratory data analysis
4.  To study possible connection between points earned and clubs’ performances and to build predictive models

Currently, the project is planned to have 4 major parts:
1.  *Functions to automate web mining*
2.  *Web mining*: including setting-up the necessary codes, data.frames, and other information
3.  *Exploratory Data Analysis*: plots to learn about and investigate interesting patterns from the mined data
4.  *Predictive Models*: statistical learning models to expand findings from part 3 further.
